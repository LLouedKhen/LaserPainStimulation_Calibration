# LaserPainStimulation_CalibrationThese functions offer two ways to establish an individual's subjective pain curve.
Note that spot size, pulse duration, and energy delivered can vary. The Stimul 1340 machine has a step function of 0.5 J.
Here, I wrote two scripts to establish individual pain levels using a staircase procedure or a random procedure. 
This repository includes the following functions:

OpenSerialConnection_Laser.py
LaserPainFunOpen.py
LaserPainFunClose.py
FireLaser.py
Calibrate_Public.py
Staircase_Procedure_Public.py
